Comprehensive List of ret2… Exploitation Techniques
1. ret2libc (Return-to-libc)

Call functions from libc directly (usually system("/bin/sh")), bypassing NX.

2. ret2plt (Return-to-PLT)

Call functions via the Procedure Linkage Table to resolve GOT entries or leak addresses.

3. ret2got (Return-to-GOT Overwrite)

Overwrite GOT entries to redirect execution (often used with format string or partial overwrite).

4. ret2dlresolve

Craft a fake ELF dynamic linker structure in memory and force the dynamic loader to resolve and call any function you want.

5. ret2csu (Call Site Utils)

Use __libc_csu_init gadgets (register setup + call) to call functions with controlled arguments.

6. ret2shellcode

Classic approach where you place shellcode in memory and redirect RIP to it. Only works if NX is disabled.

7. ret2text (ROP in .text)

Chain gadgets entirely inside the program’s .text section (not using libc).

8. ret2data

Jump into writable .data or .bss region where attacker-controlled data lives (rare nowadays because NX but still useful in some contexts).

9. ret2bss

Jump into .bss (writable, uninitialized data section), usually to store ROP chains, strings, or perform stack pivoting.

10. ret2stackpivot / ret2pivot

Pivot the stack to controlled memory (heap or .bss) using gadgets like leave; ret or adjustments to RSP.

11. ret2one_gadget (libc one_gadget)

Jump to special gadgets in libc that spawn a shell if certain register/memory constraints are satisfied.

12. ret2vtables

Hijack C++ virtual function tables (vtable pointers) to gain RIP control.

13. ret2setcontext

Use setcontext in libc to set up registers and stack frame for full ROP chain.

14. ret2sigreturn (SROP)

Trigger a fake signal frame to control registers — extremely powerful (even on x86_64).

15. ret2main / ret2loop

Return back to main or another loop to restart logic with leaked information or fresh state.

16. ret2file_operations / ret2struct

Overwrite function pointers stored in structures such as:

FILE structures (_IO_FILE)

C++ objects

operations tables

Useful in heap exploits.

17. ret2tls / ret2environ

Leak stack or libc addresses by accessing environ or TLS structures.

18. ret2jmp_buf / longjmp Abuse

Overwrite jmp_buf to jump to arbitrary code (similar to sigreturn).

19. ret2syscall (ROP Syscall Chains)

Build a ROP chain that calls syscall directly:

execve("/bin/sh")

mprotect → enable shellcode

open/read/write

20. ret2mprotect

Use a ROP chain to call mprotect to make memory executable, then jump to shellcode.

21. ret2epilogue / ret2return_sequence

Use compiler-generated function epilogues (pop; pop; pop; ret) as gadgets for register control.
