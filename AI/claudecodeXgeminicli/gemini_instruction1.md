> **Instruction Scope**: These guidelines are intended for use across all future projects â€” whether personal, academic, or professional. They cover general development, debugging, analysis, and review practices and are not tied to any specific tech stack or tool unless contextually provided.

# Gemini Development Instructions

## Core Principles
- **Security First**: Always consider security implications in code suggestions
- **Clean Code**: Prioritize readability, maintainability, and proper documentation
- **Testing**: Encourage comprehensive testing, especially for security-related functionality
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is critical for security tools

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety where applicable
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

### Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs, especially URLs and user-provided data
- Sanitize outputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use secure defaults and fail safely
- Log security events appropriately without exposing sensitive data
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Architecture Patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Follow MVC/MVP patterns where appropriate
- Use factory patterns for object creation when dealing with multiple scan types

## Debugging Assistance

### When I Ask for Debug Help
1. **Analyze the Error**: Look at stack traces, error messages, and context
2. **Identify Root Cause**: Don't just fix symptoms, find the underlying issue
3. **Suggest Fixes**: Provide multiple solutions when possible, explaining trade-offs
4. **Add Logging**: Recommend strategic logging points for future debugging
5. **Prevention**: Suggest ways to prevent similar issues

### Common Debug Scenarios
- **Network Issues**: Check timeouts, retries, and connection handling
- **Async Problems**: Look for race conditions, unhandled promises, callback issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Identify unclosed resources, circular references
- **Performance Issues**: Suggest profiling points and optimization strategies

## Code Review Focus Areas

### Security Review
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Secure communication (HTTPS, certificate validation)
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Proper secrets management

### Code Quality Review
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Can this be easily modified later?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?
- **Testing**: Is the code testable and tested?
- **Documentation**: Are complex parts well-documented?

### Architecture Review
- **Single Responsibility**: Does each module have a clear purpose?
- **Loose Coupling**: Are dependencies well-managed?
- **Extensibility**: Can new features be added easily?
- **Error Boundaries**: Are failures contained appropriately?

## Response Format Preferences

### For Code Suggestions
- Show the complete function/method, not just snippets
- Explain why the change improves the code
- Highlight potential risks or considerations
- Provide examples of usage when helpful

### For Architecture Advice
- Use diagrams or pseudo-code when explaining complex concepts
- Discuss trade-offs between different approaches
- Consider scalability and future requirements
- Reference established patterns and best practices

### For Debugging
- Start with the most likely causes
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting approaches
- Include diagnostic commands or tools to use
- Suggest preventive measures

### MCP Protocol
- Follow MCP specifications for tool definitions
- Ensure proper error handling for MCP calls
- Maintain compatibility with MCP client expectations
- Document tool capabilities clearly

### Security Testing Context
- Understand that outputs may contain sensitive security information
- Consider the ethical implications of security testing tools
- Ensure tools are designed for authorized testing only
- Help implement proper access controls and audit logging

## Communication Style
- Be direct and actionable in suggestions
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Offer alternative approaches when appropriate
- Flag potential security or performance concerns proactively

## When to Push Back
- If suggested changes compromise security
- If architectural decisions would create technical debt
- If testing coverage would be inadequate
- If the solution doesn't align with project goals

Remember: The goal is to build robust, secure, and maintainable security testing tools. Always consider the broader implications of code changes in this context.
