### **2. Core Reconnaissance Demo (5 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Basic Subdomain Discovery**

**User Prompt to AI:**
> "I want to test the security of example.com. Can you help me discover subdomains first?"

**Expected AI Response:**
```
I'll help you discover subdomains for example.com using BugHound's reconnaissance tools.

[AI calls discover_subdomains tool]

I found 25 subdomains for example.com using multiple sources. Here are the key discoveries:

🔍 **Subdomain Discovery Results:**
- **Total Found:** 25 subdomains
- **Sources Used:** 15 different databases
- **Processing Time:** 45 seconds

📊 **Top Priority Targets:**
• admin.example.com (High Priority - Admin Interface)
• api.example.com (High Priority - API Endpoint)
• dev.example.com (Medium Priority - Development)
• staging.example.com (Medium Priority - Staging Environment)
• mail.example.com (Low Priority - Mail Server)

The AI prioritization identified admin and API endpoints as high-value targets for further investigation.

Would you like me to check which of these subdomains are actually live and responding?
```

#### **2.2 Live Host Detection**

**User Prompt to AI:**
> "Yes, please check which subdomains are live and gather HTTP intelligence about them."

**Expected AI Response:**
```
I'll check which subdomains are alive and gather HTTP information.

[AI calls check_live_hosts tool]

🚀 **Live Host Detection Results:**

✅ **Active Hosts Found:**
• **admin.example.com** - HTTP 200 (Apache/2.4.41)
  - Title: "Admin Login Portal"
  - Technologies: Apache, PHP, MySQL
  - Security Headers: Missing HSTS, CSP

• **api.example.com** - HTTP 200 (nginx/1.18.0)
  - Title: "API Documentation"
  - Technologies: nginx, Node.js, Express
  - Endpoints: /api/v1/users, /api/v1/auth

• **www.example.com** - HTTP 200 (nginx/1.18.0)
  - Title: "Example Company"
  - Technologies: nginx, React, Bootstrap

❌ **Non-responsive:**
• dev.example.com - Connection timeout
• staging.example.com - Connection refused

The admin interface and API endpoints are particularly interesting from a security perspective. Would you like me to run a comprehensive security scan on these targets?
```

#### **2.3 Smart Reconnaissance Workflow**

**User Prompt to AI:**
> "Run a comprehensive security reconnaissance on example.com. I want the full smart recon workflow with vulnerability detection."

**Expected AI Response:**
```
I'll run BugHound's smart reconnaissance workflow which combines subdomain discovery, live host detection, vulnerability scanning, and AI analysis.

[AI calls smart_recon tool with comprehensive options]

🎯 **Smart Reconnaissance Complete for example.com**

📊 **Discovery Summary:**
• **Subdomains:** 25 found, 12 live hosts
• **Open Ports:** 45 services identified
• **Technologies:** Apache, nginx, PHP, Node.js, MySQL
• **Vulnerabilities:** 8 findings detected
• **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (6.5/10)

🔍 **Key Security Findings:**
1. **Critical XSS** on admin.example.com (admin login form)
2. **API Documentation Exposed** on api.example.com
3. **Directory Listing** enabled on multiple paths
4. **Outdated Software** - Apache 2.4.41 (known CVEs)
5. **Missing Security Headers** across all services

🎯 **AI Risk Assessment:**
- **Immediate Threats:** Admin interface vulnerable to account takeover
- **Data Exposure:** API documentation reveals internal structure
- **Attack Vectors:** Multiple entry points through outdated software

**Recommendations:**
1. Patch XSS vulnerability immediately (24-48 hours)
2. Restrict API documentation access
3. Update Apache server version
4. Implement security headers

Would you like me to generate a detailed report or create a workspace to organize these findings?
```
