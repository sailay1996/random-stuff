# BugHound - AI-Powered Security Assessment Platform
## Executive Overview

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

BugHound revolutionizes security testing by combining automated vulnerability discovery with artificial intelligence, delivering actionable insights through natural language conversations rather than complex technical reports.

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional security tools that require technical expertise, BugHound enables security assessment through simple conversations:
- **User**: "Check example.com for security issues"
- **BugHound**: "I found 3 critical vulnerabilities with clear steps to fix them"
