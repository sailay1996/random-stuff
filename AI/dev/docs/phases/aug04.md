## 🎬 Demo Tips & Best Practices

### **Before the Demo:**
1. **Prepare test target** - Use a safe, known domain (like example.com)
2. **Pre-run commands** - Ensure all tools work and have expected outputs
3. **Time each section** - Practice to stay within allocated time
4. **Prepare backups** - Have screenshots ready if live demo fails
5. **Test network** - Ensure reliable internet for tool execution

### **During the Demo:**
1. **Start with impact** - Lead with business value, then show technical details
2. **Use realistic scenarios** - Show actual security findings, not toy examples
3. **Explain while running** - Don't just show commands, explain the value
4. **Handle questions** - Pause for questions but keep momentum
5. **Show visual outputs** - Dashboard charts are impressive and easy to understand

### **Common Questions to Prepare For:**
- **"How accurate are the findings?"** → Show AI verification and false positive reduction
- **"How long does a typical scan take?"** → Demonstrate quick vs comprehensive modes
- **"Can it integrate with our existing tools?"** → Show export capabilities and workspace management
- **"What's the learning curve?"** → Show single-command simplicity of `analyze_target`
- **"How do we share results with clients?"** → Demonstrate professional report generation and export

### **Demo Recovery (If Something Goes Wrong):**
- **Have screenshots** of expected outputs ready
- **Use existing workspaces** if live scanning fails
- **Emphasize the architecture** and show code structure
- **Focus on completed Phase 1 & 2** achievements
- **Redirect to future roadmap** and Phase 3 planning
